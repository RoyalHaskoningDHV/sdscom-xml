# sdscom-xml
Schema definition and other specification documents of the SDScom standard

SDScom XML version 4 works under the paradigm that each safety data sheet has its own XML, i.e. this version exchanges data on a per-document level. SDScom XML version 5 changes this paradigm to cover multiple safety data sheets of the same product and editing state, but for different regions, in one XML file.
